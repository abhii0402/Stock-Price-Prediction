# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock Price Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

Project: Stock-Price-Prediction

Author: Abhishek Shukla â€” @abhii0402

Overview

A Python-based project that collects historical stock data, performs exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, trains time-series and ML models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, RandomForest), and provides scripts/notebooks for predicting future stock prices. The repository is suitable for learning, experimentation, and baseline comparisons.

Key Features

Download historical stock data (Yahoo Finance / yfinance).

Visualizations and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Feature engineering (rolling means, volatility, returns, technical indicators).

Multiple modelling approaches: classical time-series (ARIMA/Prophet), deep learning (LSTM), and ML regressors (RandomForest, XGBoost).

Train / validate / test pipelines with backtesting and walk-forward validation.

Metrics & model comparison (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, RÂ²).

Jupyter notebooks and modular scripts for reproducibility.

Quick Usage

Download data for a ticker (e.g., AAPL) and save to data/:

python src/data.py --ticker AAPL --start 2015-01-01 --end 2024-12-31 --out data/AAPL.csv

Run feature engineering:

python src/features.py --in data/AAPL.csv --out data/AAPL_features.csv

Train a model (example LSTM):

python src/train.py --config configs/lstm_config.yaml

Evaluate & plot results:

python src/evaluate.py --model outputs/lstm_best.pkl --test data/AAPL_test.csv

Notebooks

Open the notebooks in notebooks/ to reproduce EDA, visualizations, and model experiments. Notebooks include step-by-step explanations and plots.

Modeling Notes

Data split: Use time-based splitting (train / validation / test) â€” avoid random shuffling for time-series.

Scaling: Apply MinMax or StandardScaler fit on training set only.

Feature lagging: Use lag features (t-1, t-2...) and rolling windows for moving averages and volatility.

Backtesting: Implement walk-forward validation to simulate realistic forecasting.

Evaluation Metrics

Common metrics provided:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

RÂ² (Coefficient of determination)

Tips & Tricks

Try differencing or log transforms for non-stationary series before ARIMA.

For neural networks, tune sequence length, batch size, and epochs; use early stopping.

Combine models with simple ensembling (averaging or weighted blending) for better stability.

Dataset & Sources

Historical prices: Yahoo Finance via yfinance.

Optionally add fundamentals or alternative data (sentiment, news, macro indicators) to improve predictions.
